soon as possible. But I was helping to report in New York, and it took me 10 days to get back. Once here, with no assignment or story in mind, I drove to Parkland. I needed to see the school for myself. Standing alone next to the vast, improvised memorial outside its gates, I felt overcome with sadness. I rushed to my car and cried.\n\nIn late February, the photographer Sam Hodgson pitched spending some time with Sarah Lerner, the yearbook adviser, and her staff. I thought the idea was brilliant, and I was grateful that Ms. Lerner, her students and school administrators would let us in to report. I worried about how the students would react to us. But I had forgotten, in my years since covering education, how easily young people get used to having a reporter around. How often they speak truths that older people might hesitate to say out loud. How incisive their reflections and observations can be.\n\nSam and I tried to be unobtrusive, letting the students work while we hung back and watched and listened. But the computer lab was small, and we were unavoidable.\n\nStill, the students said they appreciated that we tried to blend in. They did not mince words when they shared their grievances about other journalists since the shooting. Throngs of reporters crowded the sidewalk on the day the school reopened, clamoring for a sound bite. Kyra Parrow, an 18-year-old senior, chided that reporters \u201calways ask the same questions.\u201d\n\nAt one point, I started talking with Isabel Chequer, a 16-year-old junior who was painstakingly reviewing group photos for student clubs and identifying each person pictured. To my surprise, she called the task \u201ckind of relaxing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just such a good distraction for everything going on,\u201d she said.\n\nIsabel explained a few minutes later that she had been injured in the shooting. I didn\u2019t know this; the names of the wounded had not yet been made public, and she had not shared her story with any reporter.\n\nBut there, side by side in the yearbook lab, she recounted her horrifying experience, with the remarkable poise that has characterized so many of the Parkland students.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of been overwhelming. I\u2019m kind of closed off in talking about my emotions,\u201d Isabel said. \u201cI\u2019ll never be over the grief.\u201d\n\nBut she expressed hope about the future: that a story of loss might turn into one of recovery and action.\n\n\u201cI really think we\u2019re going to do something,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to change the world forever.\u201d", "title": "A Times Reporter Returns Home to Cover a Tragedy", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/insider/reporting-parkland-shooting.html", "published": "2018-04-05T00:00:00"}, {"text": "\u201cYou can name her,\u201d my boyfriend said. \u201cI want you to name her.\u201d I knew this was manipulation \u2014 something I used to view as a cardinal sin. But I have learned, to my surprise, that close relationships rely on at least a small amount of mutual manipulation to sustain them. So I texted back. \u201cHer name is Nina, like Nina Simone.\u201d And then, after a beat, another message from me: \u201cShe\u2019s yours, though. I\u2019m not taking care of her.\u201d\n\nWhen I was growing up, we had pets all the time. Hamsters, cats, dogs. When I was 10, we moved into our first apartment after my parents\u2019 divorce. My mom told us we could get a cat, and so we did \u2014 Otis. He would play with me for hours, watching a dancing ribbon. That summer, as we watched the Democratic National Convention, he consented to wear a boater and tie, and we made him a little \u201cClinton \u201992\u201d placard. All four of us \u2014 my sisters, my mother and myself \u2014 fell deeply in love with Otis.\n\nSo it was very traumatic when my mother sat us down early one morning, just before we were supposed to leave for a long-planned vacation. We had been saving up money for months for this vacation. Instead, my mother said gravely, \u201cI have some bad news.\u201d Otis had died. He had the habit of chasing laundry into the dryer, and that particular night, my mother hadn\u2019t noticed his last frolic with a load of towels. After a beat she said, \u201cWe should probably get going on that trip.\u201d\n\nMy mother was not heartless. But she was also completely exhausted, and defeated by a life that seemed to continually snatch the one good thing she was able to do for her daughters out of her hands. We went on that vacation, weeping, and when we returned she told us we could get another cat \u2014 this time a kitten, from the shelter, who ended up so sickly we had to wash him by hand with dish soap. He passed, too, and so did the next cat. Then my mother took in three kittens from a relative whose cat had just given birth.\n\nI deigned to name one of them Ophelia, mostly because I was a dramatic snob at that point and it seemed fitting to name this cat after a famous lost girl of literature. Ophelia, however, was a boy, with an undescended testicle, who responded to this misfortune in life by spraying all of my clothing with his scent. That year I was a freshman in a new school, the only black girl in my class, and stank of cat urine because we were too poor to buy a new coat, and once that smell gets into one piece of clothing, it is difficult to remove. As you can imagine, it was a very lonely year. After that, I gave up on animals.", "title": "Opinion | My Parakeet Loves RuPaul", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/07/opinion/sunday/my-parakeet-loves-rupaul.html", "published": "2018-04-07T00:00:00"}, {"text": "For library lovers and assorted bibliophiles, the set of Sharon Washington\u2019s solo show, \u201cFeeding the Dragon,\u201d at the Cherry Lane Theater, is a geeky pleasure \u2014 long, neat rows of colorful books; card catalogs along the edges; big multipaned windows above gleaming hardwood floors. To anyone who feels most at home surrounded by things to read, it feels like an invitation: Want to hear a story? Yes, please.\n\nMs. Washington (\u201cDot,\u201d \u201cThe Scottsboro Boys\u201d) dips into her family\u2019s past to tell what is a children\u2019s story, really, which comes as a surprise. Framed as a fairy tale, it\u2019s a fond and fractured memoir of the girlhood years she spent living, with her parents and grandmother, in a three-bedroom apartment \u201con the top floor inside the St. Agnes branch of the New York Public Library,\u201d on the Upper West Side.\n\n\u201cA typical American family,\u201d Ms. Washington says. \u201cLiving in a not-so-typical place.\u201d\n\nThere is enchantment built into that premise, as if they were a family of lighthouse keepers, or had license to roam a museum after dark. When you factor in New York real estate envy (their living room was big enough for a baby grand piano, bought secondhand), the library apartment takes on an even more magical shimmer.\n\nBut for Ms. Washington\u2019s father, George, it was hardly a glamorous life. From 1969 to 1973, when the family moved to a less romantic branch, he took care of that library, polishing the floors and shoveling coal into the basement furnace \u2014 feeding the dragon, as young Sharon thought of it, her imagination stoked by books.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHis grim humor, as a black man given to comically quoting a slave scene from \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d (\u201cQuittin\u2019 time. Quittin\u2019 time!\u201d), is the first hint, early on, of Ms. Washington\u2019s ambition for the piece, directed by Maria Mileaf for Primary Stages. At its most affecting, it\u2019s a memoir of Ms. Washington\u2019s parents\u2019 perseverance and muted pain in a culture warped by racism.", "title": "Review: In \u2018Feeding the Dragon,\u2019 an Enchanted Home Inside a Library", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/theater/feeding-the-dragon-sharon-washington-review.html", "published": "2018-04-04T00:00:00"}, {"text": "Twenty-four hours later, Ms. Wood was in Los Angeles, about to perform at a touring Bowie tribute. She has a lightning bolt tattoo, from Bowie\u2019s \u201cAladdin Sane\u201d album cover, and songs like \u201cRock \u2019n\u2019 Roll Suicide\u201d were her beacon. \u201cI used to just put that on when I was at my lowest points and just wait for him to scream, \u2018You\u2019re not alone!\u2019 And that would get me through another night,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen she opened the lyric page for that song, onstage at the Wiltern in Los Angeles, her hand trembled. The words looked like symbols \u2014 \u201clike I couldn\u2019t even read,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything went white. And I thought, \u2018Oh boy. Breathe, girl, breathe.\u2019\u201d In videos from the show, you can see her hesitate and back off, then regain her momentum. She finished the number with shattering intensity.\n\n\u201cEvan is a powerhouse,\u201d said her friend Linda Perry (4 Non Blondes, Pink\u2019s \u201cGet the Party Started\u201d), the vocalist, songwriter and producer, who recommended her for the Bowie gig. \u201cWhat I like about her is, she\u2019s not afraid to be vulnerable, and that to me is an extremely powerful position to be in. She stands right there with her feet on the ground and her arms open, saying, This is who I am, this is how I\u2019m going to be, and this is how I\u2019m going to walk through life. Take it or leave it.\u201d\n\nIn Ms. Wood\u2019s telling, that position is hard won. The daughter of two actors from Raleigh, N.C., where her father runs a community theater, she began performing early, and moved to Los Angeles with her mother, an acting coach, after her parents split when she was 9. A steady career followed, but looking back, she said: \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like I had proper training for the world. I lived my whole life asking, \u2018What do you want me to do and who do you want me to be?\u2019 I was so insecure and didn\u2019t feel worthy of much.\u201d As a teenager, she began a much-ogled relationship with Marilyn Manson, the older goth rocker, to whom she was briefly engaged.\n\nOnly later in her 20s, she said, and especially after she became a mother, did she find her voice. The 2016 election also impelled her to act, to set an example for her son.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn between Seasons 1 and 2 of \u201cWestworld,\u201d Ms. Wood filmed an indie drama, \u201cAllure,\u201d out now, in which she plays the gaslighting abuser of a teenage girl. It was not fun to play, she said, but a painful story she felt needed to be told. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be famous, for me it has to mean something, or be used for something, because otherwise it just freaks me out,\u201d she said.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe playlist we\u2019d been listening to all day \u2014 her soundtrack for the revolution \u2014 is called \u201cInvincible,\u201d she said. In a flannel shirt, dark jeans and cowboy boots embossed with stars, she was unguarded and casual, peppering the conversation with \u201cDude!\u201d and the click, every now and then, of a fidget cube, to channel her energy. Her house is cozy but feels half-lived in \u2014 she\u2019s still in Los Angeles often. \u201cWestworld\u201d shoots in the Utah desert; to lighten the mood on set, she and her co-star James Marsden, as a \u201chost\u201d gunfighter, run their lines as Veronica Corningstone and Ron Burgundy, from \u201cAnchorman.\u201d (She puts on her coaching voice; he\u2019s dense.

To balance those competing preferences, you need a great vertical-search engine, which was something Adam and Shivaun had thought a lot about.\n\nPhoto\n\nSoon the Raffs began daydreaming about turning their idea into a moneymaker. They didn\u2019t have the funds to compete with huge dating sites like Match.com, so they applied for a couple of patents and began brainstorming. They believed that their vertical-search technology was good \u2014 better, in fact, than almost anything they had seen online. Best of all, it was built to work well on almost any kind of data set. With just a bit of tinkering, it could search for cheap airline tickets, or great apartments, or high-paying jobs. It could handle questions with hard-to-compare variables, like what\u2019s the cheapest flight between London and Las Vegas if I\u2019m trying to choose between business class or leaving after 3 p.m.?\n\nAs far as they could tell, their search technology performed better on such problems than Google did, which Adam discovered when he tried to buy an iPod online. \u201cI spent half an hour searching Google for the lowest price, and it drove me completely mad,\u201d he told me. It was impossible for him to figure out which sites were selling iPods and which were selling accessories, like headphones or charging cords. Or Google would show Adam one price, but then the actual price was completely different. Or there was an extra charge for shipping. It seemed to Adam his technology would do a much better job.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGoogle executives, had they known of Adam\u2019s frustrations, probably wouldn\u2019t have been surprised. For years, Google had been trying to build a tool for comparing online prices. \u201cThe idea was you should be able to input any item, and we\u2019d show you the best place to buy it,\u201d says Brian Larson, a technical lead for what was then named Froogle and today is called Google Shopping. Larson\u2019s team was small \u2014 just himself and one other programmer at first, and roughly a dozen people at its height \u2014 and Larson would regularly test how Froogle compared with other online price-comparison services. \u201cSometimes we were neck and neck; sometimes, not so much,\u201d Larson said. \u201cWe had a hundred million product listings, which was better than competitors.\u201d But they were often outperformed by sites like PriceGrabber.com, which had many more employees devoted to price comparisons.\n\nFroogle\u2019s limitations tended to pop up particularly when users included too many search parameters. For a while, Larson had a specific test search that Froogle kept failing, something like \u201cwhite running shoes and cheap and free shipping.\u201d Inevitably, the first result would be a Christmas elf wearing running shoes that some guy was selling online. No matter how Google\u2019s engineers fiddled with their coding, they couldn\u2019t stop the elf from appearing as the top link. Eventually, a manager bought the elf so it wouldn\u2019t appear in the search results anymore. \u201cWe made elf T-shirts,\u201d Larson told me. \u201cIt became our mascot.\u201d\n\nAdam and Shivaun\u2019s technology was good enough to tell the difference between an elf wearing running shoes and an actual pair of running shoes. It was good enough, in fact, to figure out which websites charged hidden shipping fees and which offered truly good deals. So the Raffs quit their jobs, hired a few programmers, spent months perfecting their technology and, in early 2006, unveiled Foundem.com, a vertical-search engine for finding cheap online prices, to a small group of friends and associates. Each time someone used Foundem to buy something, the Raffs would receive a small payment from the website making the sale. Adam and Shivaun weren\u2019t sure their company would succeed \u2014 there were already a couple of other big price-comparison search engines, like PriceGrabber, NexTag and, of course, Google itself \u2014 but they figured this was how the internet was supposed to work: Two people with a new idea can take on giants and, if their technology is good enough, grow into colossi themselves.\n\nThe Raffs knew they would have to rely on Google to find customers. For one thing, as evidenced by the name Foundem, they weren\u2019t marketing geniuses. (\u201cIt\u2019s like we found \u2019em for you, you know?\u201d Shivaun explained.) But early tests indicated that Foundem usually came up high in Google\u2019s search results whenever people submitted queries like \u201ccompare prices xr-1000 motorcycle helmets.\u201d Six months later, they opened Foundem to the world, and initial traffic was encouraging. \u201cSearch engines liked the site,\u201d Shivaun told me. \u201cThat\u2019s supposed to be the recipe for success.\u201d As long as their vertical-search technology was strong, the Raffs figured, Google would guide shoppers to their door.\n\nGoogle has succeeded where Genghis Khan, communism and Esperanto all failed: It dominates the globe. Though estimates vary by region, the company now accounts for an estimated 87 percent of online searches worldwide. It processes trillions of queries each year, which works out to at least 5.5 billion a day, 63,000 a second. So odds are good that sometime in the last week, or last hour, or last 10 minutes, you\u2019ve used Google to answer a nagging question or to look up a minor fact, and barely paused to consider how near-magical it is that almost any bit of knowledge can be delivered to you faster than you can type the request. If you\u2019re old enough to remember the internet before 1998, when Google was founded, you\u2019ll recall what it was like when searching online involved AltaVista or Lycos and consistently delivered a healthy dose of spam or porn. (Pity the early web enthusiasts who innocently asked Jeeves about \u201camateurs\u201d or \u201csteel.\u201d)\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s very likely you love Google, or are at least fond of Google, or hardly think about Google, the same way you hardly think about water systems or traffic lights or any of the other things you rely on every day. Therefore you might have been surprised when headlines began appearing last year suggesting that Google and its fellow tech giants were threatening everything from our economy to democracy itself. Lawmakers have accused Google of creating an automated advertising system so vast and subtle that hardly anyone noticed when Russian saboteurs co-opted it in the last election. Critics say Facebook exploits our addictive impulses and silos us in ideological echo chambers. Amazon\u2019s reach is blamed for spurring a retail meltdown; Apple\u2019s economic impact is so profound it can cause market-wide gyrations. These controversies point to the growing anxiety that a small number of technology companies are now such powerful entities that they can destroy entire industries or social norms with just a few lines of computer code. Those four companies, plus Microsoft, make up America\u2019s largest sources of aggregated news, advertising, online shopping, digital entertainment and the tools of business and communication. They\u2019re also among the world\u2019s most valuable firms, with combined annual revenues of more than half a trillion dollars.\n\nIn a rare display of bipartisanship, lawmakers from both political parties have started questioning how these tech giants grew so powerful so fast. Regulators in Missouri, Utah, Washington, D.C., and elsewhere have called for greater scrutiny of Google and others, citing antitrust concerns; some critics have suggested that our courts and legislatures need to go after tech firms in the same way the trustbusters broke up oil and railroad monopolies a century ago. But others say that Google and its cohort are guilty only of delighting customers. If these tech leviathans ever fail to satisfy us, their defenders argue, capitalism will punish them the same way it once brought down Yahoo, AOL and Myspace.\n\nAt the core of this debate is a question that is more than a century old: When does a megacompany\u2019s behavior become so brazen that it violates the law? In the early 1900s, just after the Industrial Revolution, the federal government provided an answer by suing one of America\u2019s largest companies, Standard Oil, on the novel theory that big becomes bad when a giant uses its dominance not only to defeat its competitors but also to extinguish the possibility that competition might occur.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn its technological innovation, Standard Oil was the Google of its day. The company\u2019s founder, John D. Rockefeller, had become the richest man in America by spending millions of dollars hiring scientists to transform how oil was refined and transported. And those innovations earned the public\u2019s admiration. In 1858, before Standard Oil was founded, lighting a home required whale oil, which cost up to $3 a gallon, putting illumination out of reach for all but the wealthiest of households. By 1885, after Standard Oil figured out how to refine kerosene, it cost just 8 cents a gallon to brighten the night. \u201cLet the good work go on,\u201d Rockefeller wrote to a partner. \u201cWe must ever remember we are refining oil for the poor man and he must have it cheap and good.\u201d\n\nStandard Oil\u2019s technological discoveries gave the company huge advantages over its rivals, and Rockefeller exploited those advantages ruthlessly. He cut secret deals with railroads so that other firms had to pay more for transportation. He forced smaller refineries to choose between selling out to him or facing bankruptcy. \u201cRockefeller and his associates did not build the Standard Oil Co. in the boardrooms of Wall Street,\u201d wrote Ida Tarbell, a muckraking journalist of the day. \u201cThey fought their way to control by rebate and drawback, bribe and blackmail, espionage and price cutting, and perhaps more important, by ruthless, never slothful efficiency of organization.\u201d\n\nIn 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt ordered his Justice Department to sue Standard Oil for antitrust violations. But government lawyers faced a quandary: It wasn\u2019t illegal for Standard Oil to be a monopoly. It wasn\u2019t even illegal to compete mercilessly. So government prosecutors found a new argument: If a firm is more powerful than everyone else, they said, it can\u2019t simply act like everyone else. Instead, it has to live by a special set of rules, so that other companies get a fair shot. \u201cThe theory was that competition is good, and if a monopoly extinguishes competition, that\u2019s bad,\u201d says Herbert Hovenkamp, co-author of a seminal treatise on antitrust law. \u201cOnce you become a monopoly, you have to start acting differently, and if you don\u2019t, then what you\u2019ve been doing all along starts breaking the law.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court agreed and split Standard Oil into 34 firms. (Rockefeller received stock in all of them and became even wealthier.) In the decades following the Standard Oil breakup, antitrust enforcement generally abided by a core principle: When a company grows so powerful that it becomes a gatekeeper, and uses that might to undermine competitors, then the government should intervene. And in the last century, as courts have censured other monopolies, academics and jurists have noticed a pattern: Monopolies and technology often seem intertwined. When a company discovers a technological advantage \u2014 like the innovations of Rockefeller\u2019s scientists \u2014 it sometimes makes that firm so powerful that it becomes a monopoly almost without trying very hard. Many of the most important antitrust lawsuits in American history \u2014 against IBM, Alcoa, Kodak and others \u2014 were rooted in claims that one company had made technological discoveries that allowed it to outpace competitors.\n\nFor decades, there seemed to be a consensus among policymakers and business leaders (though not always among targeted companies) about how the antitrust laws should be enforced. But around the turn of this century, a number of tech companies emerged that caused some people to question whether the antitrust formula made sense anymore. Firms like Google and Facebook have become increasingly useful as they have grown bigger and bigger \u2014 a characteristic known as network effects. What\u2019s more, some have argued that the online world is so fast-moving that no antitrust lawsuit can keep pace. Nowadays even the biggest titan can be defeated by a tiny start-up, as long as the newcomer has better ideas or faster tech. Antitrust laws, digital executives said, aren\u2019t needed anymore.\n\nConsider Microsoft. The government spent most of the 1990s suing Microsoft for antitrust violations, a prosecution that many now view as a complete waste of time and money. When Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, Bill Gates, signed a consent decree to resolve one of its monopoly investigations in 1994, he told a reporter that it was essentially pointless for the company\u2019s various divisions: \u201cNone of the people who run those divisions are going to change what they do or think.\u201d Even after a federal judge ordered Microsoft broken into separate companies in 2000, the punishment didn\u2019t take. Microsoft fought the ruling and won on appeal. The government then offered a settlement so feeble that nine states begged the court to reject the proposal. It was approved.\n\nWhat eventually humbled Bill Gates and ended Microsoft\u2019s monopoly wasn\u2019t antitrust prosecutions, observers say, but a more nimble start-up named Google, a search engine designed by two Stanford Ph.D. dropouts that outperformed Microsoft\u2019s own forays into search (first MSN Search and now Bing). Then those two dropouts introduced a series of applications, like Google Docs and Google Sheets, that eventually began to compete with almost every aspect of Microsoft\u2019s businesses. And Google did all that not by relying on government prosecutors but by being smarter. You don\u2019t need antitrust in the digital marketplace, critics argue. \u201cWhen our products don\u2019t work or we make mistakes, it\u2019s easy for users to go elsewhere because our competition is only a click away,\u201d Google\u2019s co-founder, Larry Page, said in 2012. Translation: The government ought to stop worrying, because no online giant will ever survive any longer than it deserves to.\n\nOnce Foundem.com was available to everyone, the company\u2019s honeymoon lasted precisely two days. During its first 48 hours, the Raffs saw a rush of traffic from users typing product queries into Google and other search engines. But then, suddenly, the traffic stopped. Alarmed, Adam and Shivaun began running diagnostics. They quickly discovered that their site, which until then had been appearing near the top of search results, was now languishing on Google, mired 12 or 15 or 64 or 170 pages down. On other search engines, like MSN Search and Yahoo, Foundem still ranked high. But on Google, Foundem had effectively disappeared. And Google, of course, was where a vast majority of people searched online.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Raffs wondered if this could be some kind of technical error, so they began checking their coding and sending email to Google executives, begging them to fix whatever was causing Foundem to vanish. Figuring out whom to write, and how to contact them, was a challenge in itself. Although Google\u2019s parent company bills itself as a diversified firm with about 80,000 employees, almost 90 percent of the company\u2019s revenues derive from advertisements, like the ones that show up in search. As a result, there are few things more important to Google\u2019s executives than protecting the firm\u2019s search dominance, particularly among the most profitable kinds of queries, such as those of users looking to buy things online. In fact, at about the same time the Raffs were starting Foundem.com, Google executives were growing increasingly concerned about the threats that vertical-search engines posed to Google\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cWhat is the real threat if we don\u2019t execute on verticals?\u201d one Google executive emailed his colleagues in 2005, according to internal documents later shared with the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cLoss of traffic from Google.com because folks search elsewhere for some queries,\u201d he wrote, in answer to his own question. \u201cIf one of our big competitors builds a constellation of high-quality verticals, we are hurt badly,\u201d the internal documents continued. Another executive put it more bluntly: \u201cGoogle\u2019s core business is monetizing commercial queries. If users go to competitors such as Amazon to do product queries, long-term revenue will suffer.\u201d\n\nGoogle executives began holding battle-plan meetings for the vertical war. Shortly after Foundem.com went online, one executive issued an order: Henceforth, Google\u2019s own price-comparison results should appear at the top of many search pages, as quickly as possible, even if that meant disregarding the natural results of the company\u2019s search algorithm. \u201cLong term, I think we need to commit to a more aggressive path,\u201d a high-ranking Google employee wrote to colleagues. Eventually, a mandate came from the chief executive: \u201cLarry thought product should get more exposure,\u201d a senior official wrote.\n\nOne way to get that exposure was to influence the rules governing how Google displayed search results. In 2006, Google instituted a shift in its search algorithm, known as the Big Daddy update, which penalized websites with large numbers of subpages but few inbound links. A few years later, another shift, known as Panda, penalized sites that copied text from other websites. When adjustments like these occurred, Google explained to users, they were aimed at combating \u201cindividuals or systems seeking to \u2018game\u2019 our systems in order to appear higher in search results \u2014 using low-quality \u2018content farms,\u2019 hidden text and other deceptive practices.\u201d\n\nLeft unsaid was that Google itself generates millions of new subpages without inbound links each day, a fresh page each time someone performs a search. And each of those subpages is filled with text copied from other sites. By programming its search engine to ignore other sites doing the same thing that Google was doing, critics say, the company had made it nearly impossible for competing vertical-search engines, like Foundem, to show up high in Google\u2019s results.\n\nShivaun and Adam sent email after email to Google executives, but no one responded with anything useful. So the Raffs started making phone calls. Those didn\u2019t help much, either. Adam and Shivaun had worked in technology for decades. They were well known and had connections to important people inside Google and at other big firms. But none of that seemed to matter.\n\nAs the months went by and Foundem\u2019s bank accounts dwindled, the Raffs, desperate, began approaching other websites, offering to adapt their technology to power those sites\u2019 internal search engines. Soon they were providing back-end technology for a popular motorcycle site and a large magazine publisher. Eventually, about 2.5 million people were seeing Foundem\u2019s search results each month. Foundem was named one of Britain\u2019s best travel comparison sites by The Times of London and celebrated on a popular British gadget show. But without traffic from Google, the Raffs were barely holding on.\n\nThree years passed this way. Some nights, Shivaun would sit at her computer, exhausted, Googling phrase after phrase \u2014 How do you lift a Google website penalty? Who at Google reviews mistakes? Google and deindexed and phone number and help \u2014 hoping that some magic combination of words might yield a new solution. \u201cIt just felt so unfair,\u201d Shivaun told me. \u201cWe had great technology. It was winning awards. But we couldn\u2019t even get an explanation from Google about why we weren\u2019t showing up.\u201d Eventually, they sought out a public relations firm, in the hope that a newspaper article might get Google\u2019s attention. The P.R. firm had an additional suggestion: Why not file an antitrust complaint? To Adam and Shivaun, that seemed like a waste of time. If Microsoft had been able to shrug off the antitrust attacks of the United States government, why would Google care about a complaint filed by some small firm?\n\nBut they didn\u2019t see many other options. So Adam and Shivaun pulled out their laptops and began assembling a long document detailing everything they had experienced. Then they went to Brussels, to the headquarters of the European Commission, the agency charged with regulating competitive behavior, and filed a complaint accusing Google of violating antimonopoly laws.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs the years passed, Shivaun and Adam got into the habit of visiting message boards where people obsessively discussed Google\u2019s many peculiarities. They began to notice an interesting pattern among companies complaining about the search giant: Often, the aggrieved parties had, in some way, posed some kind of threat to Google\u2019s business. And they seemed to have suffered dire consequences.\n\nThere was, for instance, Skyhook Wireless, which had invented a new navigation system that competed with Google\u2019s location software and had signed major deals with the cellphone manufacturers Samsung and Motorola. Skyhook\u2019s accuracy \u201cis better than ours,\u201d one Google manager speculated in an internal email later revealed in a lawsuit filed by Skyhook against Google. Not long after that note was written, according to the lawsuit, a high-ranking Google official pressured Samsung and Motorola to end their relationships with Skyhook \u2014 and implied that if they didn\u2019t, Google could make it impossible for them to ship their phones on time. (Google has denied doing anything inappropriate.) Soon, Samsung and Motorola canceled their Skyhook contracts. Skyhook sued Google, and though one suit was dismissed, Google ended up paying $90 million to settle a patent-infringement claim. But by then it was too late. Skyhook\u2019s founders, bereft of other partnership options, had been forced to sell their company at a large discount.\n\nThen there was Yelp, a website with millions of user-generated reviews of local brewpubs, auto-body shops and other businesses. Yelp grew quickly as local queries \u2014 like \u201cbest nearby steakhouse\u201d \u2014 became a third of all online searches. For years, Yelp appeared near or at the top of millions of Google searches. Google, hoping to capitalize on that traffic, tried to buy Yelp in 2009, but Yelp\u2019s founders rejected those advances. Then Google started pulling Yelp\u2019s content into its own results, which meant many users didn\u2019t have to visit Yelp\u2019s website. Yelp complained \u2014 to Google and later to the F.T.C. \u2014 but Google said the only alternative was for Yelp to remove its content from Google altogether, according to documents filed with federal regulators. The same thing happened at other fast-growing review sites like TripAdvisor and Citysearch, which also complained to the F.T.C. \u201cWe still exist,\u201d says Luther Lowe, a vice president at Yelp, \u201cbut Google did everything it could to ensure that we\u2019d never present a threat to them. It\u2019s bullying, but they\u2019re the 800-pound gorilla.\u201d\n\nThe more Adam and Shivaun looked, the more examples they found. Getty Images had created a popular search engine to help users comb through the firm\u2019s 170 million photographs and other visual art. Then, in 2013, Google adjusted how it displayed images so that rather than directing people to Getty\u2019s website, users could easily see and download Getty\u2019s high-definition images from Google itself. \u201cOur traffic immediately fell 85 percent,\u201d says Yoko Miyashita, Getty\u2019s general counsel. \u201cWe wrote to Google, and said, Hey, this isn\u2019t cool. And their response was, \u2018Well, if you don\u2019t agree to these terms, we\u2019ll just exclude you\u2019 \u201d \u2014 by letting Getty remove itself from the search engine entirely, Miyashita said. \u201cThat\u2019s not really a choice, because if you aren\u2019t on Google, you basically don\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nTradeComet.com, which operated a vertical-search engine for finding business products, initially prospered by buying ads on Google, but as the site grew, Google \u201craised my prices by 10,000 percent, which strangled our business virtually overnight,\u201d the company\u2019s C.E.O. at the time, Dan Savage, said when he filed an antitrust lawsuit in 2009. KinderStart.com, a vertical-search engine for parents, sued Google after it received a \u201cPageRank\u201d of zero, making it essentially unfindable. (TradeComet.com\u2019s suit was dismissed on a technicality; KinderStart.com\u2019s was dismissed for insufficient evidence.)\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They printed out lawsuits and regulatory complaints until their living room was a maze of paper.\n\nEventually the Raffs reached out to the F.T.C., which, they knew, was the American equivalent of the European Commission\u2019s antitrust office, and the U.S. regulators invited them to visit. The F.T.C.\u2019s staff, it turned out, had been quietly collecting complaints about Google for years. In 2012, those officials wrote a confidential 160-page report that said Google had \u201cadopted a strategy of demoting, or refusing to display, links to certain vertical websites in highly commercial categories.\u201d That memo, about half of which was accidentally sent to reporters at The Wall Street Journal after they submitted a Freedom of Information Act request, said that \u201cGoogle\u2019s conduct has resulted \u2014 and will result \u2014 in real harm to consumers and to innovation.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoogle has strengthened its monopolies over search and search advertising through anticompetitive means,\u201d which \u201cwill have lasting negative effects on consumer welfare,\u201d F.T.C. officials wrote. They cited instances in which Google seemed purposely to be privileging less useful information, substandard search results and suboptimal links. \u201cAlthough it displays its flight search above any natural search results for flight-booking sites, Google does not provide the most flight options for travelers,\u201d the regulators wrote. Whereas a decade earlier someone searching for steakhouses would have seen a long list of websites, now the most noticeable results pointed to Google\u2019s own listings, including Google maps, Google local search or advertisers paying Google. Some F.T.C. staff recommended \u201cthat the Commission issue a complaint against Google\u201d for copying material and certain advertising and contract practices, though not search-engine bias.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGoogle responded to the report\u2019s claims by arguing that the changes it made to the search engine benefited users. \u201cOur testing has consistently showed that users want quick answers to their queries,\u201d Google said in a statement when contacted about this article. \u201cIf you are searching for weather, you probably want a forecast, not just links to weather sites.\u201d And when it comes to online shopping, the statement read, \u201cif someone is searching for products, they likely want information about price and where they can buy it. They probably don\u2019t want to be taken to another site where they have to enter their search again. . . . We absolutely do not make changes to our search algorithm to disadvantage competitors.\u201d Claims to the contrary, like those made by Foundem, are untrue, Google maintained. \u201cWe make hundreds of changes to search every year, all with the same goal: Delivering users the best, most relevant search results,\u201d the company continued. \u201cEach change, large and small, affects millions of sites, some who see their rankings improve, others who drop.\u201d And, Google concluded, \u201cour ultimate responsibility is to deliver the best results possible to our users, not specific placements for sites within our results.\u201d\n\nWhen the F.T.C.\u2019s politically appointed leadership considered the staff\u2019s recommendations, they declined to sue Google, surprising many inside the agency. \u201cWhile not everything Google did was beneficial, on balance, we did not believe that the evidence supported an F.T.C. challenge,\u201d the agency\u2019s chairman at the time, Jon Leibowitz, said when he announced the decision in 2013.\n\nThe F.T.C.\u2019s decision, according to agency insiders, was motivated in part by a debate that has also sparked battles within antitrust courts over the last 40 years: Should the law protect consumers or encourage competition? They\u2019re not always synonymous. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t consumers who were complaining about Standard,\u201d says Hovenkamp, the antitrust scholar. \u201cIt was the other oil companies.\u201d Similarly, few users are kvetching about Google; it\u2019s primarily other tech firms. United States judges have increasingly held that the government must show consumer harm to win in court.\n\nAdam and Shivaun didn\u2019t have to wait for the official F.T.C. announcement to know that their case was going nowhere. Meeting with officials in Washington, they could tell: These people were not going to prosecute. They had come to the United States at their own expense. They had written memo after memo arguing that Google was treating them unfairly and as a result hurting users. They had done everything they were asked. Standard Oil controlled 64 percent of the market for refined petroleum when the Supreme Court broke it into dozens of pieces. Google and Facebook today control an estimated 60 to 70 percent of the U.S. digital advertising market. And the F.T.C. seemed happy to let them keep doing it. To the Raffs, it felt as if history was repeating itself, as if the pointless, ineffectual Microsoft case was happening all over again. It felt as if nobody cared.\n\nIf you are younger than 29 \u2014 which just happens to be the average age of a Google employee, according to a survey done by PayScale \u2014 then odds are good you don\u2019t remember much about the Microsoft antitrust battles of the 1990s. So, a quick primer: For almost a decade, starting in 1993, federal and state prosecutors besieged Microsoft in courtrooms across the nation, arguing that the company had acted in ways that were predatory and dishonest to preserve its software monopoly. One Microsoft executive was quoted in court as threatening to \u201ccut off\u201d the \u201cair supply\u201d of a competitor. \u201cIs Bill Gates the \u201990s answer to Don Corleone?\u201d Time magazine asked. \u201cI expected to find a bloody computer monitor in my bed,\u201d a witness told investigators.\n\nAlong the way, Microsoft was accused of widespread bullying, coercion and general obnoxiousness. And Microsoft basically said: Whatever. \u201cThere\u2019s one guy in charge of licenses,\u201d Bill Gates told reporters after he signed a consent decree with the Department of Justice in 1994. \u201cHe\u2019ll read the agreement.\u201d Everyone else, the implication was, would ignore it.\n\nEven when a judge ruled in 2000 that Microsoft was violating antitrust law, conventional wisdom held that the victory was largely pyrrhic. Microsoft successfully appealed, and prosecutors eventually threw in the towel, agreeing to abandon their attacks and settle if Microsoft agreed to token reforms, such as making its products more compatible with competitors\u2019 software and giving three independent observers unfettered access to the company\u2019s records, employees and source code. Microsoft\u2019s executives thought that three observers, versus 48,000 employees, sounded like pretty good odds.\n\nThis was the history the Raffs recalled when they heard the F.T.C. was abandoning its investigation. But then, they also remembered a discussion they had once had with a lawyer named Gary Reback, who told them that everything they\u2019d heard about the Microsoft trials was wrong. Reback is something of a legend in Silicon Valley, both because of his accomplishments as an antitrust provocateur and because of his anxious \u2014 some might say paranoid \u2014 worldview. Reback has been known to call other lawyers late at night and leave long, obsessively detailed voice mail messages about legal arguments and economic theories. He was featured on a 1997 cover of Wired magazine with the headline \u201cThis Lawyer Is Bill Gates\u2019s Worst Nightmare,\u201d a boast that wasn\u2019t far-off: Working on behalf of clients like Netscape and Sun Microsystems, Reback had browbeaten the Department of Justice into suing Microsoft for antitrust.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBy the time Adam and Shivaun started visiting the F.T.C., Reback had exchanged his antipathy of Microsoft for a disdain of Google and had accompanied them on their visits with regulators. There\u2019s a loose coalition of economists and legal theorists who call themselves the New Brandeis Movement (critics call them \u201cantitrust hipsters\u201d), who believe that today\u2019s tech giants pose threats as significant as Standard Oil a century ago. \u201cAll of the money spent online is going to just a few companies now,\u201d says Reback (who disdains the New Brandeis label). \u201cThey don\u2019t need dynamite or Pinkertons to club their competitors anymore. They just need algorithms and data.\u201d\n\nReback had told Adam and Shivaun that it was important for them to keep up their fight, no matter the setbacks, and as evidence he pointed to the Microsoft trial. Anyone who said that the 1990s prosecution of Microsoft didn\u2019t accomplish anything \u2014 that it was companies like Google, rather than government lawyers, that humbled Microsoft \u2014 didn\u2019t know what they were talking about, Reback said. In fact, he argued, the opposite was true: The antitrust attacks on Microsoft made all the difference. Condemning Microsoft as a monopoly is why Google exists today, he said.\n\nSurprisingly, some people who worked at Microsoft in the 1990s and early 2000s agree with him. In the days when federal prosecutors were attacking Microsoft day and night, the company might have publicly brushed off the salvos, insiders say. But within the workplace, the attitude was totally different. As the government sued, Microsoft executives became so anxious and gun-shy that they essentially undermined their own monopoly out of terror they might be pilloried again. It wasn\u2019t the consent decrees or court decisions that made the difference, according to multiple current and former Microsoft employees. It was \u201cthe constant scrutiny and being in the newspaper all the time,\u201d said Gene Burrus, a former Microsoft lawyer. \u201cPeople started second-guessing themselves. No one wanted to test the regulators anymore.\u201d\n\nIn public, Bill Gates was declaring victory, but inside Microsoft, executives were demanding that lawyers and other compliance officials \u2014 the kinds of people who, previously, were routinely ignored \u2014 be invited to every meeting. Software engineers began casually dropping by attorneys\u2019 desks and describing new software features, and then asking, in desperate whispers, if anything they\u2019d mentioned might trigger a subpoena. One Microsoft senior executive moved an extra chair into his office so a compliance official could sit alongside him during product reviews. Every time a programmer detailed a new idea, the executive turned to the official, who would point his thumb up or down like a capricious Roman emperor.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Microsoft\u2019s top executives told some divisions that their plans would be proactively shared with competitors \u2014 literally describing what the company intended to create before software was even built \u2014 to make sure it wouldn\u2019t offend anyone who was likely to sue. Microsoft\u2019s engineers were outraged. But they went along with it.\n\nAnd most important, as Microsoft lived under government scrutiny, employees abandoned what had been nascent internal discussions about crushing a young, emerging competitor \u2014 Google. There had been informal conjectures about reprogramming Microsoft\u2019s web browser, the popular Internet Explorer, so that anytime people typed in \u201cGoogle,\u201d they would be redirected to MSN Search, according to company insiders. Or, perhaps a warning message might pop up: \u201cDid you know Google uses your data in ways you can\u2019t control?\u201d\n\nMicrosoft was so powerful, and Google so new, that the young search engine could have been killed off, some insiders at both companies believe. \u201cBut there was a new culture of compliance, and we didn\u2019t want to get in trouble again, so nothing happened,\u201d Burrus said. The myth that Google humbled Microsoft on its own is wrong. The government\u2019s antitrust lawsuit is one reason that Google was eventually able to break Microsoft\u2019s monopoly.\n\n\u201cIf Microsoft hadn\u2019t been sued, all of technology would be different today,\u201d Reback told me. We\u2019ve known since Standard Oil that advances in technology make it easier for monopolies to emerge. But what\u2019s less recognized is the importance of antitrust in making sure those new technologies spread to everyone else. In 1969 the Justice Department started a lawsuit against IBM for antitrust violations that lasted 13 years. The government eventually surrendered, but in an earlier attempt to mollify prosecutors, IBM eliminated its practice of bundling hardware and software, a shift that essentially created the software industry. Suddenly, new start-ups could get a foothold simply by writing programs rather than building machines. Microsoft was founded a few years later and soon outpaced IBM.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOr consider AT&T, which was sued by the government in 1974, fought in court for eight years and then slyly agreed to divest itself of some businesses if it could keep its most valuable assets. Critics complained AT&T was getting the deal of a lifetime. But then start-ups like Sprint and MCI made millions building on technologies AT&T championed, and AT&T found itself struggling to compete. It\u2019s completely wrong to say that antitrust doesn\u2019t matter, Reback argues. \u201cThe internet only exists because we broke up AT&T. The software industry exists because Johnson sued IBM.\u201d\n\nIt was critical that the Raffs continue fighting, Reback told them. Social embarrassment and sustained attacks have the power to succeed when courtrooms or political agencies fail. After their F.T.C. disappointment, the Raffs flew back to England to consider their options. And then one night they were at home watching television when the phone rang. Someone they had met in Brussels was calling to share some remarkable news. The European Commission had issued a decision on the complaint they filed six years before.\n\nWhat changed everything was a middle-aged Danish politician named Margrethe Vestager, who had recently been named the European Union\u2019s commissioner for competition. Vestager was an unusual choice for the post. She wasn\u2019t a populist crusader or a pro-business acolyte; she was, instead, a moderate whose claim to fame, at that point, was having served as an inspiration for the television show \u201cBorgen,\u201d a fictional series about a Danish politician. But Vestager was awarded the commissioner\u2019s post in 2014 after arguing that European marketplaces needed to do a better job of giving everyone an equal chance to succeed. Since assuming her office, Vestager has become, unexpectedly, the most prominent antitrust official in the world, invited to speak at conferences and mobbed by autograph seekers.\n\nBy the time Vestager took office, Google had already transitioned its price-comparison service to its present incarnation, which is effectively an advertising system that prominently features links only from companies that pay for the promotion. (Users are notified by a small logo that says \u201csponsored.\u201d) After reviewing the complaints submitted by the Raffs and others, Vestager announced she intended to formally charge Google with antitrust violations. (She has also embarked on investigations into the European tax practices of Starbucks, Amazon and Apple, as well as anticompetitive tactics at Qualcomm, Facebook and Gazprom.)\n\nOver the next two years, Vestager\u2019s staff reviewed data from 1.7 billion Google queries. They scrutinized how people fared when they conducted searches on topics in which Google had a vested interest, versus those where the company had nothing to gain. Then, in June of last year, the commission issued its final verdict: \u201cWhat Google has done is illegal under E.U. antitrust rules,\u201d Vestager said in a statement released at the time. \u201cIt denied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate. And most important, it denied European consumers a genuine choice of services and the full benefits of innovation.\u201d Google was ordered to stop giving its own comparison-shopping service an illegal advantage and was fined an eye-popping $2.7 billion, the largest such penalty in the European Commission\u2019s history and more than twice as large as any such fine ever levied by the United States.\n\nThe verdict rocked Silicon Valley. Some think Europe\u2019s assertiveness makes it more likely American regulators will act as well. And there\u2019s evidence that\u2019s already starting. Donald Trump appealed to voters, in part, by attacking the tech monopolies. In a case of truly odd bedfellows, that puts him in alignment with Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who have long called for greater scrutiny of technology companies. Last year, a group of Democratic lawmakers in Congress, led by Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, sponsored legislation to boost antitrust enforcement by forcing companies to assume the burden of showing that a merger won\u2019t hurt the public.\n\nMeanwhile, a bipartisan assortment of state attorneys general have urged the F.T.C. to reopen its investigation of Google. Most major antitrust battles, including the federal suits against Microsoft and Standard Oil, have begun as state actions. A Missouri investigation is particularly notable because the state\u2019s Republican attorney general, Josh Hawley, who is running for the United States Senate, has subpoenaed information to see if Google has manipulated searches to disadvantage potential competitors. \u201cThe Obama-era F.T.C. did not take any enforcement action against Google, did not press this forward and has essentially given them a free pass,\u201d Hawley told reporters after revealing his inquiry in November. \u201cI will not let Missouri consumers and businesses be exploited by industry giants.\u201d\n\nAs attacks against Google have escalated, the company has tried to limit the damage. After Yelp complained to the F.T.C. about Google\u2019s stealing its content, Google promised to make it easier for websites to opt out of automatic copying, a pledge it reaffirmed a few months ago. And earlier this month, in exchange for Getty Images\u2019 withdrawing its complaint to the European Commission, Google signed a licensing agreement with Getty promising to more clearly display images\u2019 copyright information. Other titans like Facebook are similarly trying to get ahead of criticisms, voluntarily pledging greater transparency and promising to work more cooperatively with regulators.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe implication is clear enough: Google and the other tech titans understand that the landscape is shifting. They realize that their halos have become tarnished, that the arguments they once invoked as a digital exception to American economic history \u2014 that the internet economy is uniquely self-correcting, because competition is only a click away \u2014 no longer hold as much weight. \u201cWhen you get as big as Google, you become so powerful that the market bends around you,\u201d Vestager told me. The notion that antitrust law isn\u2019t needed anymore, that we must choose between helping consumers or spurring competition, no longer seems sufficient reason to exempt the tech giants from century-old legal codes. If anything, Vestager\u2019s verdict and state investigations indicate that companies like Google may have more in common with the monopolists of old than most people thought. Silicon Valley\u2019s bigwigs ought to be scared.\n\n\u201cIf Europe can prosecute Google, then we can as well,\u201d says William Kovacic, a law professor and former Republican-appointed chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cIt\u2019s just a question of willingness now.\u201d\n\nIf the internet\u2019s potentates are frightened, however, they\u2019re doing a good job of hiding it. Google has appealed the European Commission\u2019s decision and has vigorously defended itself online. The company\u2019s arguments are the same ones that it was putting forth on company blogs over the course of the investigation. \u201cWe disagree with the European Commission\u2019s argument that our improved Google Shopping results are harming competition,\u201d Google\u2019s top lawyer wrote in one post. The commission \u201cdrew such a narrow definition around online shopping services that it even excluded services like Amazon,\u201d undermining the contention that Google is dominant. \u201cGoogle delivered more than 20 billion free clicks to aggregators over the last decade,\u201d he wrote in another post. Forcing it to \u201cdirect more clicks to price-comparison aggregators would just subsidize sites that have become less useful for consumers.\u201d Google\u2019s data indicates that users appreciate how the search engine has shifted over the years. \u201cThat\u2019s not \u2018favoring\u2019 \u201d Google\u2019s interests, the company said. \u201cThat\u2019s giving customers and advertisers what they find most useful.\u201d\n\nSome legal theorists think that Google might have a point. \u201cTo what extent are consumers, rather than competitors, being harmed by Google?\u201d says Hovenkamp, the antitrust scholar. \u201cIf the answer is \u2018not much,\u2019 then I\u2019m suspicious of an antitrust remedy.\u201d Others say the risks are too high. \u201cThere are very real costs associated with suing a company like Google,\u201d says Geoffrey Manne, executive director of the International Center for Law & Economics, a nonpartisan research center. \u201cYou\u2019re potentially impairing a firm that provides vital services to millions of people, and potentially benefiting competitors who don\u2019t deserve that support.\u201d\n\nThose are fair arguments. But they are also, in some ways, beside the point. Antitrust has never been just about costs and benefits or fairness. It\u2019s never been about whether we love the monopolist. People loved Standard Oil a century ago, and Microsoft in the 1990s, just as they love Google today.\n\nRather, antitrust has always been about progress. Antitrust prosecutions are part of how technology grows. Antitrust laws ultimately aren\u2019t about justice, as if success were something to be condemned; instead, they are a tool that society uses to help start-ups build on a monopolist\u2019s breakthroughs without, in the process, being crushed by the monopolist. And then, if those start-ups prosper and make discoveries of their own, they eventually become monopolies themselves, and the cycle starts anew. If Microsoft had crushed Google two decades ago, no one would have noticed. Today we would happily be using Bing, unaware that a better alternative once existed. Instead, we\u2019re lucky a quixotic antitrust lawsuit helped to stop that from happening. We\u2019re lucky that antitrust lawyers unintentionally guaranteed that Google would thrive.\n\nPut differently, if you love technology \u2014 if you always buy the latest gadgets and think scientific advances are powerful forces for good \u2014 then perhaps you ought to cheer on the antitrust prosecutors. Because there is no better method for keeping the marketplace constructive and creative than a legal system that intervenes whenever a company, no matter how beloved, grows so large as to blot out the sun. If you love Google, you should hope the government sues it for antitrust offenses \u2014 and you should hope it happens soon, because who knows what wondrous new creations are waiting patiently in the wings.\n\nFor the Raffs, however, it\u2019s probably too late. By the time Vestager announced her verdict and record-setting fine last year, it had been 12 years since Adam and Shivaun started Foundem.com. During that time, their lives slowly but inexorably became devoted to battling Google. They had spent thousands of hours corresponding with regulatory agencies across the globe. They had filed a civil suit against Google in British court, a case that is ongoing. They basically shut down Foundem, creating more time for them to give advice to other companies and regulators fighting Google. This consulting work, some of which was funded by Google\u2019s competitors, has helped to keep the Raffs afloat. And if the Raffs win their lawsuit against Google, it could be worth millions. \u201cBut it\u2019s a different business model than we expected,\u201d Adam told me. \u201cIt\u2019s also deeply frustrating, because we became technologists in order to build new technologies. We never intended to be professional plaintiffs or antitrust crusaders.\u201d\n\nOne of the most difficult things for the Raffs over the past decade has been figuring out how to explain this journey to themselves and others. Even friends and family didn\u2019t fully understand what was going on. \u201cIt feels really good to be validated like this, to be told we were right,\u201d Shivaun told me, referring to Vestager\u2019s verdict. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t turn back the clock and give us another chance. Even if we win in Brussels, or win our lawsuit, in some ways, we were still defeated. We were still beaten by Google.\u201d", "title": "The Case Against Google", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/20/magazine/the-case-against-google.html", "published": "2018-02-20T00:00:00"}, {"text": "Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, made a big announcement this week: The E.P.A. will reconsider, and most likely roll back, Obama-era automobile standards for greenhouse gas emissions and fuel efficiency. The decision goes beyond what even the automakers had asked for, and sets up a showdown with California over air pollution rules.\n\nBut headlines in recent days have focused on Mr. Pruitt himself as he faces a growing list of potential ethics scandals. It can be hard to follow every development, so let us catch you up on some of the biggest ones dogging Mr. Pruitt this week.\n\nTravel: Mr. Pruitt is still under fire for extensive first-class and business-class travel. Records obtained by the Environmental Integrity Project and reviewed by The New York Times showed that two weeks of travel in June for the administrator and his aides cost taxpayers more than $120,000. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is reviewing Mr. Pruitt\u2019s travel, as is the E.P.A.\u2019s inspector general. On Tuesday Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, wrote to Mr. Pruitt asking him to explain a $40,000 five-day trip to Morocco with staff in December. Mr. Whitehouse cited the administrator\u2019s calendar for the trip, which showed one full workday and two other days with one hourlong meeting each. The E.P.A. did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nRaises: Amid all the scrutiny of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s travel and personal finances, other issues are brewing inside the agency. The Atlantic broke a story Tuesday showing that the administrator bypassed the usual White House procedures to give political appointees substantial raises. The aides, Sarah Greenwalt and Millan Hupp, had both worked for Mr. Pruitt in Oklahoma, where he served as attorney general before coming to the E.P.A. Ms. Greenwalt\u2019s salary was raised to $164,200 from $107,435, while Ms. Hupp\u2019s was raised to $114,590 from $86,460. Citing anonymous sources, the article outlines how Mr. Pruitt reappointed the aides with higher salaries under a provision of the Safe Drinking Water Act after the White House did not approve the raises. The E.P.A. did not dispute the story.\n\nOn Wednesday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, was asked whether Mr. Trump was \u201cO.K.\u201d with Mr. Pruitt\u2019s apartment arrangement. \u201cThe president\u2019s not,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re reviewing the situation. When we have had a chance to have a deeper dive on it, we\u2019ll let you know the outcomes of that, but we\u2019re currently reviewing that here at the White House.\u201d", "title": "A Trip to Morocco.

It is clinically proven that alcohol raises irritability levels in the alcoholic, so frequent bouts of anger, edginess and verbal abuse (if not physical) are some common sights in households where alcoholic parents dwell. Alcoholics are either drinking or thinking or recovering from alcohol; their priorities just succumb to their bottles of hops and grains. If your partner is alcoholic, it is time to take control of the situation as his/her ways are hurting your children the most.How alcoholism affects your children?1. Children who grow under the aegis of alcoholic parent/s get utterly confused at first and find it difficult to comprehend what makes their father/mother behave under the influence of alcohol.2. Gradually they develop coping skills; however, many find it difficult to become sociable due to fear of shame for their parent\u2019s behaviour.3. Such children don\u2019t live a free life that they are supposed to. They suppress their feelings and become vulnerable to anxiety and depression.4. An apprehensive home environment created by an alcoholic parent can impair their emotional health, cognitive skills, and brain function.5. Such children can grow up with low self-esteem, insecurity, mistrust, and a lot of stress, which can further dampen their future relationships.What can you do as a parent?If your partner is alcoholic or indulges in other substance abuse, then as a parent it is your foremost duty to safeguard and protect your children from such influence. Alcoholism is a disease, not a lifestyle. Having a drink or two at the end of the day could be a way to relax or de-stress; however, if it\u2019s more than that and impacting your home environment then you need to take action.Refer your partner to a De-Addiction center and get suitable plan to treat alcoholism. If that doesn\u2019t help and you see the pattern same, then sending your partner to a Rehabilitation center is ideal for your partner\u2019s physical and mental health as well as for his financial and professional growth. And it is just the right thing for your children for whom you are responsible to create a loving and caring environment.Lastly, if your partner cannot recover after a Rehab, then you must not keep victimizing yourself and your children.
